# ORP Metar Information Module
The metar information module is used to get METAR (weather) information from ICAO locations, usually airports, and announces them over the air. You can request a METAR from an airport of your interest.

This is a packaged version of that module intended to be used with OpenRepeater. The SVXLink code was written by Adi Bier (DL1HRC) and the ORP wrapper code and package was added by Aaron Crawford (N3MBH).
